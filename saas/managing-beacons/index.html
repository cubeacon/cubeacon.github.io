<p>Cubeacon developer site does not only cover beacon from our factory, but also manage your beacon data from other factory.</p>

<h3>Works with box code</h3>

<p>When you buy product from cubeacon you will get a box code. This code as a helper to input beacon data automatically. That can be executed just one time. After that, it will be expired or not valid. Figure out the result of data execution code is true. If there are any problems you can contact the cubeacon support factory. Default alert message of each beacon can be set by filling the message at tab alert. If you don't do that, it will follow apps message.</p>
